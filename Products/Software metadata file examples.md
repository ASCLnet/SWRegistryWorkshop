One goal of this workshop was to assist participating registries and repositories with creating software metadata files, specifically codemeta.json and/or CITATION.cff files, from their own entries to offer to software authors for use on their own code sites or repos. The deliverable for this goal was to "Examples of registry entries rendered in CodeMeta and/or CFF files." Below are links to these examples.

#### CoMSES
CoMSES includes a standalone codemeta.json file in every computational model download. The codemeta.json file included in the download zip file for its entry for [DogPopDy: ABM for ABC planning (version 1.0.0)](https://www.comses.net/codebases/33e71fe5-2d11-42ec-bb1e-9f725196d567/releases/1.0.0/) is shown below.
