## Workshop products and results
  
Two major goals of the workshop were to complete the development of best practices for discipline-specific software registries and repositories, and to improve adoption of emerging software metadata file standards, with a focus on CodeMeta and the Citation File Format files, across our varied disciplines. Products of the workshop that support these goals are listed below.
